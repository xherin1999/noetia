# 6.1 # Mind-Native Scenario Library – Noetia (v0.1)

*Working draft. This is not a product, not a token, not legal advice. Just axioms and sketches for an alternative worldline.*

---

## 0. What is “Noetia”? (working description)

In this note, **Noetia** is a *provisional name* for a **mind-native area**:

- It is a jurisdiction / zone that **implements the two core axioms**:
  1. A mind has and only has full sovereignty over itself.  
  2. There are no innate external obligations; all obligations must come from contracts the mind chose to bind itself to.
- Institutions in Noetia are built as **intelligent, contract-based systems**:
  - POM-like protocols for mind presence and continuity.  
  - LDAOs and ServiceDAOs for coordination and services.  
  - γ-contracts for specific spaces / venues.
- Noetia is **not a nation-state fantasy** here; it is a **minimal stage**:
  - a hypothetical environment where the axioms are taken seriously;  
  - used to host scenarios that show how daily life could work under them.

Everything in this document should be read as:  
> “If somewhere like Noetia existed, here is how certain situations could be handled there.”

## 1. Purpose

This note collects **concrete, human-scale scenarios** showing how the mind-native axioms, POM, BSC, LDAO and Noetia-style contracts actually play out in daily life.

It is not a specification. It is a **scenario library**: each vignette is a small “world-fragment” you can run mentally to test whether the axioms behave sanely.

Core axioms assumed:

1. **Mind sovereignty** – a mind has and only has full sovereignty over itself.  
2. **No innate external obligations** – there are no obligations to others that do not arise from contracts the mind bound itself to.  
3. **Institutional intelligence** – any institution that claims authority over a mind must be understandable and addressable by that mind as a system of contracts/protocols.  
4. **Exit in principle** – contracts may be heavy and costly, but must not erase mind-hood or make exit logically impossible.

We assume some existing infrastructure:

- A family of **Proof of Mind (POM)** protocols.  
- A subclass **POM-I** (proof of identity continuity), linked to each mind’s BSC.  
- A dedicated fork **POM-C** used by CareDAOs to assess when a dependent mind is ready to sign its own contracts.  
- **Liquid DAOs (LDAO)** and **ServiceDAOs** as the main organizational forms.  
- **γ-contracts** for specific venues/spaces (rules of entry, safety, behavior).

## 2. Scenario A: Solo noetist in a legacy city

### 2.1 Setup

- **M** is a mind living in a legacy (non-Noetia) city.  
- M has:
  - One or more POM handles (addresses) proving “some mind here”.  
  - A **Baseline Self-Contract (BSC)** describing:
    - how M defines “continuity” for itself (for POM-I);  
    - which classes of contracts M is willing to sign;  
    - which classes M rejects (e.g. irrevocable, hereditary).

### 2.2 Daily life sketch

- **Income / work**  
  - M offers skills via several small LDAO-like collectives (e.g. remote dev, research, translation).  
  - Each LDAO routes revenue to M’s handle according to on-chain flow rules; M can rebalance or exit at any time.

- **Housing**  
  - M uses a **Housing ServiceDAO** instead of a traditional landlord.  
  - The contract is explicit: monthly payment, notice periods, what counts as damage, what happens in dispute. No “moral landlord” layer.

- **Healthcare / risk**  
  - M signs a medical ServiceDAO contract: terms for emergency visits, optional add-ons, what data can be shared.  
  - No “you must live a certain lifestyle” innate duty; only whatever clauses M accepted.

- **Relationships**  
  - Any long-term partnership uses explicit, modular contracts:
    - financial pooling (or not),  
    - exit rules,  
    - care obligations (if any) defined as voluntary clauses, not “fate”.

This scenario shows: **even inside a legacy state**, one noetist can already live primarily through **self-chosen, explicit contracts** and treat all state/family pressures as external noise, not legitimate sources of Obl.

## 3. Scenario B: CareDAO and dependent minds

### 3.1 Core idea

A **CareDAO** is an LDAO specialized in:

- Hosting, feeding, educating and protecting **dependent minds** (children, cloned minds, newly booted AIs, etc.).  
- Doing so under contracts that:
  - protect the dependent mind’s future sovereignty,  
  - minimize “birth-based” or “creator-based” innate obligations.

### 3.2 Contracts involved

1. **Founders’ charter**  
   - Founders of the CareDAO sign a contract defining:
     - how funds are managed,  
     - what minimum care standard is,  
     - what kind of discipline and risk is allowed,  
     - how guardians or staff can be rotated/removed.

2. **Care contract for each dependent mind**  
   - For each new mind `m_dep`, a Care contract C_care is instantiated:
     - C_care defines the **care obligations** the DAO takes on;  
     - it may include optional **future mutual obligations** that only become active if `m_dep` later signs.

3. **POM-C: maturity protocol owned by the CareDAO**

Instead of using some global “POM-B for children”, each CareDAO maintains its own **POM-C** fork:

- POM-C is designed and updated by the DAO to test:
  - whether a dependent mind has reached the capacity required to understand and sign contracts;  
  - whether it can read and meaningfully edit a BSC.  
- POM-C is modular and upgradable (v0.1, v0.2…), but the CareDAO is obliged by its charter to:
  - make POM-C public,  
  - explain it to the mind in accessible ways,  
  - allow third-party review and forks.

### 3.3 Transition to full sovereignty

At some point:

- `m_dep` passes POM-C under publicly audited conditions.  
- `m_dep` then drafts or chooses its own **BSC**, possibly with help from mentors / tools.  
- Only after that:
  - `m_dep` can sign or reject C_care as an adult mind.  
  - Any ongoing obligations towards the CareDAO become **ordinary contract obligations**, not “because they raised you”.

Key point: the CareDAO does not own the mind. It only holds **temporary care duties** under a transparent contract, with a well-defined path to full self-contracting.

## 4. Scenario C: Housing as a ServiceDAO

### 4.1 Instead of landlords

A **Housing ServiceDAO** manages buildings and units. Its contract:

- Specifies exactly:
  - pricing and indexation rules,  
  - maintenance obligations,  
  - what counts as damage / misuse,  
  - dispute resolution paths.

- Is **fully inspectable** by any mind before joining.  
- Uses LDAO-style flows:
  - renters can move between sub-pools (e.g. quiet building vs. party building) based on their preferences and history.

### 4.2 Exit handling

- Exit is always logically possible:
  - there may be notice periods, deposits, and penalties,  
  - but no “you can never leave this landlord” trap.

- If a Housing DAO tried to bake in “eternal tenancy” or “inheritance-based duty” clauses, it would:
  - contradict mind sovereignty axioms,  
  - be treated as invalid / ill-typed by Noetia-compatible tooling.

## 5. Scenario D: Work & income flows via LDAO

### 5.1 Liquid collectives, not fixed firms

Instead of fixed companies:

- Minds join project-specific **LDAOs**:
  - LDAO-dev-α, LDAO-research-β, LDAO-art-γ, etc.  
  - Each LDAO has its own rules for:
    - how contribution is measured,  
    - how revenue is shared,  
    - how forks occur if the community disagrees.

- A mind can belong to many LDAOs at once with different **weight vectors**:
  - 20% of their time/attention to LDAO-dev-α,  
  - 50% to LDAO-research-β,  
  - 30% to LDAO-art-γ.

### 5.2 Router as personal “income vector field”

Each mind runs (or uses) a **Router**:

- Router is a personal policy that:
  - takes incoming revenues from various LDAOs,  
  - splits them across expenses (housing, care, savings, fun),  
  - adjusts when the mind changes preferences or contracts.

- Router is also **exit-aware**:
  - if a mind decides to exit LDAO-dev-α,  
  - Router stops allocating time/effort there and moves flows to alternatives.

This scenario demonstrates how **firm boundaries become fluid**, and how micro-level discontent can instantly materialize as forks and vector rebalancing.

## 6. Scenario E: Spaces with γ-contracts

### 6.1 What are γ-contracts?

A **γ-contract** is a contract attached to a specific **space / venue / context**:

- Example: a bar, a clinic, an online forum, a maker space.  
- The γ-contract defines:
  - entry conditions,  
  - allowed and forbidden behaviors,  
  - local enforcement rules,  
  - how disputes in that space are handled.

It is **opt-in**: entering the space = agreeing to the γ-contract.  
Leaving the space = γ-contract no longer applies (except for already triggered consequences).

### 6.2 Examples

1. **Drug-free venue**  
   - A venue whose γ-contract says:
     - no psychoactive substances inside;  
     - if you break it, you can be removed and temporarily banned.  
   - No mind is forced to sign this;  
     but if you want this space’s benefits, you accept its rules while inside.

2. **High-risk lab space**  
   - A biotech or cybernetics lab with:
     - strict safety protocols;  
     - surveillance and logging;  
     - heavy consequences for protocol violations.  
   - These are not “innate duties to humanity”, but explicit **risk contracts** for that context.

3. **Ultra-free space**  
   - A venue with minimal γ-rules;  
   - It advertises itself as high-risk, high-freedom;  
   - Minds entering do so knowing that many “protective structures” are absent there.

γ-contracts make it possible to have **very different micro-worlds** coexisting inside Noetia:  
from quasi-authoritarian monasteries to chaotic clubs, all under the same top-level axioms of mind sovereignty and contract grounding.
