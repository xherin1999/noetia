# 3.1 # Liquid DAOs (LDAO) – Core Patterns (v0.1)

*Working draft. This is not a product, not a token, not legal advice. Just axioms and sketches for an alternative worldline.*

---

## 1. What is an LDAO?

An LDAO (Liquid DAO) is a pattern for organizations where:

- **Governance, funding, and versions are fluid**, not monolithic.  
- **Forking is microscopic and continuous**, not a rare catastrophic event.  
- A DAO is not a fixed “city”, but a **temporary vortex in a flowing field of cashflows and minds**.

In a classical DAO:

- There is one main contract, one treasury, one canonical set of rules.  
- Disagreements accumulate until a big vote, a hard fork, or ragequit.

In an LDAO:

- Any dissatisfaction, even about a tiny feature or parameter, can be turned into a **micro-fork**.  
- That micro-fork is a live, deployable variant with slightly different configuration.  
- If it is better, **capital and participation naturally flow into it** via individual routing, not central decree.

An LDAO is both:

- A **shape**: a way to represent organizations as overlapping, ever-shifting branches rather than static entities.  
- A **protocol pattern**: concrete interfaces and logic for routing value, instantiating forks, and interfacing with physical infrastructure.

---

## 2. Core building blocks (engineering view)

This section describes LDAO as an engineering pattern: which contracts and components we assume, and how they talk to each other.

### 2.1 LDAO Core: configurable governance kernel

An “LDAO Core” is a minimal governance kernel with:

- A **config object** (or config tree) capturing:  
  - Voting rules (thresholds, quorums, delegation rules)  
  - Roles and permissions (who can propose, who can execute)  
  - Resource policies (how funds are allocated, how parameters update)
- A **forkable configuration schema**:  
  - Configs are versioned objects: `Config_v0`, `Config_v1`, …  
  - A fork is formally: `NewConfig = BaseConfig ⊕ Diff`
- A **registry of branches**:  
  - Each branch has an ID, a pointer to its config, and optionally its own state (e.g. local treasury, metrics).  
  - Branches can share some state (e.g. shared infrastructure pool) or maintain separate local states.

Key idea:

> To fork an LDAO is primarily to fork its *configuration* and optionally its *treasury routing*,  
> not to redeploy an entirely unrelated new protocol.

### 2.2 Portfolio Routers: value as flow

Each mind (participant) is assumed to control one or more **Portfolio Router** contracts:

- A Router receives incoming value (income, revenue, donations) from that mind.  
- It holds a **weight vector over branches / LDAOs**:

  Router_m:  
  (LDAO_A_main: 0.6,  
   LDAO_A_variant: 0.3,  
   LDAO_B: 0.1)

- According to this vector, the Router continuously routes funds to each target:  
  - Periodically (e.g. hourly/daily settlement), or  
  - Using streaming payment protocols.

Changing one’s participation is then:

- Not “selling all your shares” or “ragequitting the org”.  
- But **adjusting weights** in the Router:  
  - e.g. reducing `LDAO_A_main` from 0.6 → 0.2, increasing `LDAO_A_variant` from 0.3 → 0.7.

In other words:

> Membership and funding of an LDAO are not booleans (“in / out”),  
> but **continuous weights** chosen by each mind over time.

### 2.3 ServiceDAOs: bridging physical assets and infrastructure

Physical assets (offices, data centers, factories, machines) are costly, non-fungible, and jurisdiction-bound.  
LDAOs do *not* try to “fork buildings”. Instead:

- Physical and heavy infrastructure are managed by separate **ServiceDAOs** (or InfraDAOs) that:  
  - Operate SPVs / companies in the real world.  
  - Hold ownership / lease / usage rights to physical assets.  
  - Issue **on-chain usage tokens**:  
    - e.g. office-desk-by-month, rack space and power, compute-hours, bandwidth, storage.

LDAOs then:

- Use their routed funds to **buy or rent usage tokens** from ServiceDAOs.  
- Decide internally who can use which resources, according to their own governance.

When an LDAO forks:

- The physical asset does not split.  
- What changes is:  
  - Which branch (or which set of branches) pays for which usage tokens.  
  - How those usage rights are allocated internally.

This lets LDAOs stay fluid in the governance/value layer,  
while ServiceDAOs handle the slow, heavy layer of physical reality.

---

## 3. Financial structure: “funding = sum of pledges” (finance view)

### 3.1 Value as flow, not as a static pool

In a classical firm or DAO:

- Funding is often imagined as a **static treasury**: “we have X in the bank”.  
- Capital budgeting means: once per cycle, decide how to allocate that pool.

In an LDAO:

- The primary object is **not** the treasury, but the **sum of pledged flows**:

  Flow_L(t) = Σ_{m ∈ Participants(L)} p_m(t) · Income_m(t)

  where:  
  - Income_m(t) is the cashflow into mind m at time t.  
  - p_m(t) is the fraction that m routes to LDAO L at time t via its Router.

Treasury contracts still exist, but:

- They are **buffers** for flows already routed in.  
- The deeper “asset” of an LDAO is its **expected future inflow**,  
  determined by the current configuration of participants’ Routers.

From a finance perspective:

> An LDAO holds a portfolio of **income-sharing pledges** from minds,  
> not just a static pile of assets.

### 3.2 Pledges, lockups, and long-term projects

Purely short-term, fully adjustable pledges are fragile:

- Participants can always reduce p_m(t) to zero.  
- That creates “run” and “bank-run” patterns if confidence collapses.

LDAOs can therefore introduce **voluntary commitment instruments**, e.g.:

- **Locked pledges**:  
  - A mind can sign: “for N months, my pledge to L will not drop below X%”.  
  - In return, they may receive higher upside, governance weight, or priority access.
- **Long-horizon LDAOs** (VC / endowment style):  
  - Specialized LDAOs that accept long-term pledges (e.g. 5–10 years) to back:  
    - early-stage projects,  
    - deep infra,  
    - long-horizon research and public goods.
- **Debt- and fee-like claims**:  
  - Some LDAOs or ServiceDAOs can issue:  
    - fixed-yield notes backed by pledged flows,  
    - revenue-sharing instruments,  
    - futures on usage or cashflows.

Thus, the system can:

- Keep **high liquidity and reconfigurability** at the edge (Routers, micro-forks), and  
- Build **long-term stability** in specialized layers that aggregate and transform risk and duration.

## 4. Forking as everyday operation (engineering + dynamics)

### 4.1 From “big-bang forks” to continuous micro-forks

In most chains and DAOs today:

- A fork is a big event:  
  - contentious vote,  
  - hard chain split,  
  - major liquidity fragmentation.

In an LDAO:

- The **unit of change** is a **config diff** plus optional changes in routing.  
- Micro-forks can be:  
  - one parameter change (fees, thresholds),  
  - one module swap (voting rule variant),  
  - or one policy tweak (how a specific resource pool is handled).

Protocol-level assumptions:

- Forking a branch is cheap (config copy + diff).  
- New branches are discoverable:  
  - e.g. displayed as “alternative profiles” of the same LDAO core.  
- Routers can add weights to new branches with minimal friction.

Forking is no longer a rebellion. It is:

> **“I will run my own variant now;  
> if it’s better, others can send some of their flow this way.”**

### 4.2 From user complaint to live branch

A typical LDAO flow can look like:

1. **Dissatisfaction**  
   - A participant dislikes one small behavior:  
     - a UI rule,  
     - a fees policy,  
     - a grant allocation pattern.

2. **Suggestion → config diff**  
   - The complaint is translated (by tools or by the participant) into a **config diff**:  
     - “same as LDAO_A main, except: parameter X = new value”.

3. **Automatic branch instantiation**  
   - The LDAO Core:  
     - instantiates a new branch `LDAO_A_variant`,  
     - attaches the new config to it,  
     - links it as “child of LDAO_A main”.

4. **Routing update**  
   - The participant’s Router adds a new entry:  
     - reduces weight to the main branch, increases weight to the variant.  
   - Others, if they agree, can mirror or choose their own blend.

5. **Selection by flows**  
   - If the variant is genuinely better,  
     **more flow (funds, participation, usage) will migrate**:  
     - its treasury inflow grows,  
     - its activity metrics rise,  
     - ServiceDAO purchases might shift.

The protocol guarantees:

- Micro-forks are cheap and safe to create.  
- No one is forced to follow.  
- “Success” is measured by **naturally routed flows**, not by decree.

### 4.3 Avoiding liquidity dust

To avoid fragmenting liquidity into a million tiny pools:

- New branches can start as **virtual branches**:  
  - they exist in the config space,  
  - track pledged interest (future flow),  
  - but do not immediately receive a separate treasury.
- Only when a branch passes thresholds (e.g. total pledged flow ≥ 1% of L’s total, or ≥ X units per period):  
  - it is promoted to a **full branch with a distinct treasury**.
- Frontends and APIs can **aggregate**:  
  - Show major vortices (big branches) by default.  
  - Hide or cluster tiny experimental forks unless explicitly requested.

This keeps the **expressive power** of fine-grained forking,  
while maintaining usable capital density and UX.

## 5. Examples (compressed scenarios)

This section gives a few short examples to anchor the pattern.

### 5.1 Remote workers’ LDAO + shared office (ServiceDAO)

- `ServiceDAO_Office`:  
  - Operates a building in the physical world.  
  - Issues tokens: “desk-month”, “meeting-room-hour”.
- `LDAO_RemoteGuild`:  
  - A cooperative of remote workers.  
  - Members route part of their income to `LDAO_RemoteGuild` via Routers.  
  - The LDAO uses this flow to buy office usage tokens from `ServiceDAO_Office`,  
    and allocates them according to its own rules.

A participant dislikes the booking / quiet-zone rules.

- They propose a config diff:  
  `LDAO_RemoteGuild_variant` with stricter noise rules.  
- A new branch is instantiated.  
- Some members route 30–70% of their pledge to the variant.  
- Over time:  
  - If the variant works better, it may gather more pledge,  
    buy more usage tokens, and become the de facto main branch.  
  - The original branch may shrink or specialize.

No building is forked. Only:

- **who pays** and  
- **under which rules**  
changes.

### 5.2 Infra LDAO + ServiceDAO for compute

- `ServiceDAO_Compute`:  
  - Owns/leases datacenters.  
  - Issues “compute-hour” and “storage-GB-month” tokens.
- `LDAO_Infra`:  
  - Aggregates funding from many projects that need cheap compute.  
  - Negotiates bulk purchase from `ServiceDAO_Compute`.  
  - Provides subsidized or prioritized access to its members.

If `LDAO_Infra` splits into:

- a conservative cost-focused branch and  
- a privacy-maximalist, redundancy-heavy branch,

participants and projects route their pledge flows accordingly.  
Compute usage follows funds; infra does not care about ideology, only contracts.

### 5.3 VC LDAO and endowment LDAO

- `LDAO_VC`:  
  - Accepts **long-term pledges** from minds willing to take early-stage risk.  
  - Invests in new branches, ServiceDAOs, protocols.  
  - Issues claims on potential upside (equity-like instruments).
- `LDAO_Endowment`:  
  - Accepts non-retractable or very long-duration pledges.  
  - Funds public goods, foundational research, long-horizon infrastructure.

These specialized LDAOs perform **duration transformation**:

- They absorb volatile short-term flows at the edge.  
- They output longer-term, more stable commitments for heavy projects.

## 6. Philosophical implications (post-firm, post-budget, post-agency)

LDAOs are not just an engineering pattern; they encode a philosophical stance:

1. **Post-firm structure**

   - Classical firms exist because market transactions are costly.  
   - LDAOs assume:  
     - cheap recomposition (forks),  
     - cheap routing (Routers),  
     - cheap coordination (smart contracts).  
   - The distinction “inside the firm vs. market” collapses into:  
     - overlapping vortices in a shared flow field.

2. **Post-capital-budgeting**

   - Traditional capital budgeting is:  
     - centralized, periodic decisions by a management layer.  
   - LDAOs decentralize this into:  
     - continuous, granular reweighting of pledge flows by each mind.  
   - “Budget” becomes:  
     - the emergent result of many tiny, ongoing routing choices.

3. **Shifted agency problem**

   - In classical organizations, agency is:  
     - shareholders vs managers, principals vs agents.  
   - In LDAOs:  
     - Much of that is flattened:  
       - If a branch behaves badly, pledge flows can exit at the edge.  
     - New agency questions move to:  
       - who designs the protocols,  
       - who runs ServiceDAOs,  
       - who owns default interfaces and aggregators.

From a mind-native perspective:

> LDAOs are one way to operationalize a world  
> where minds route their own obligations and resources,  
> and where “organizations” are emergent, forkable patterns in that routing.

## 7. Limitations and open problems

LDAOs are not magic. They have structural challenges:

- **Complexity and cognitive load**  
  - High-resolution markets are cognitively expensive.  
  - Most minds will rely on defaults, aggregators, and social heuristics.
- **Procyclicality and runs**  
  - High liquidity of pledges means:  
    - flows can rush in during hype,  
    - and vanish quickly during fear.
- **Long-term heavy projects**  
  - Require explicit design of:  
    - lockups,  
    - long-horizon LDAOs (VC, endowment),  
    - robust ServiceDAO contracts.
- **Regulatory and jurisdictional friction**  
  - ServiceDAOs touching physical assets and legal entities  
    will collide with existing corporate and state structures.

This v0.1 does not solve these. It only:

- fixes the core pattern (“forks as breathing, funding as flow”), and  
- sketches the main components:

> LDAO Core, Portfolio Routers, and ServiceDAOs.

Further work can refine:

- security models,  
- market microstructure,  
- UX patterns,  
- and integration with identity / mind-proof layers in a mind-native worldline.
