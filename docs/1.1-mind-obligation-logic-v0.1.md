# 1.1 # Mind-Obligation Logic – v0.1

This note gives a **formal skeleton** for the idea:

> All obligations on a mind must come from contracts that mind chose to bind itself to.  
> There are no obligations to the outside world without contracts.

It is a technical appendix to the Core Charter:  
we assume the axioms “mind has sovereignty only over itself” and “no innate external obligations”,  
and make them precise in a small logical system.

## 1. Basic vocabulary

We work in a many-sorted first-order setting. We only fix the minimal vocabulary needed to talk about minds, contracts, and obligations.

Sorts:

- `Mind` — entities capable of reasoning and taking responsibility.  
- `Contract` — explicit, computable commitments between minds.  
- (Optional) `Time` — if we want to express exit and duration.

Core predicates / functions:

- `Mind(m)` — m is a mind.  
- `Contract(C)` — C is a contract.  
- `bind(m, C)` — mind m is bound to contract C (normatively).  
- `Obl(m, φ)` — m has an obligation to make proposition φ true.  
- `Consented(m, C)` — m has (in some valid way) consented to contract C.  
- `Clause(C, m, φ)` — C contains a clause that directly imposes φ on m.  
- `Clause*(C, m, φ)` — from clauses of C that apply to m, φ follows under the adopted rules of interpretation.

We deliberately **do not** fix a particular syntax for φ.  
φ can be “m pays x to n”, “m refrains from action a”, “state S holds” etc., as long as there is a workable notion of entailment in `Clause*`.

## 2. Core schemas: how obligations arise

In this system, we do not take `Obl` as a primitive moral modality.  
Instead, we **define its admissible uses** by three schemas.

### 2.1 Consent ⇒ binding

Binding is the normative status of being under a contract.  
Its justification comes from consent:

\[
\forall m,C \big( Mind(m) \wedge Contract(C) \wedge Consented(m,C) \rightarrow bind(m,C) \big)
\]

We do **not** say this is the only way `bind` can arise (e.g. delegated consent, earlier meta-contracts are allowed), but any legitimate binding of a mind must be traceable, eventually, to some form of that mind’s own consent.

How `Consented(m, C)` is established (POM, signatures, rituals, long-term behaviour) is left to separate POM specifications.

---

### 2.2 Contract-grounding: no obligation without a contract

The central constraint is that obligations on a mind must be grounded in contracts that mind is bound to.

We capture this with a two-way schema:

1. **Grounding direction**  

If m has an obligation, it must have a contractual source:

\[
\forall m,\varphi \big( Obl(m,\varphi) \rightarrow \exists C \; [ Contract(C) \wedge bind(m,C) \wedge Clause^*(C,m,\varphi) ] \big)
\]

2. **No obligation in the void**  

If no such contract exists, there is no obligation:

\[
\forall m,\varphi \big( (\neg \exists C \; [Contract(C) \wedge bind(m,C) \wedge Clause^*(C,m,\varphi)]) \rightarrow \neg Obl(m,\varphi) \big)
\]

Taken together, these two clauses act as a **definitional constraint** on `Obl`:

> In this logic, “Obl(m, φ)” is only allowed to be true  
> when there exists at least one contract C such that  
> `bind(m, C)` and `Clause*(C, m, φ)` hold.

There is no such thing as a free-floating “ought” on a mind.

---

### 2.3 Non-innateness as a theorem scheme

We do **not** introduce a special axiom “there are no innate obligations”.  
Instead, we let schemas 2.1 and 2.2 do the work.

Consider any proposed “innate duty” axiom, for example:

\[
\forall child,parent \big( ChildOf(child,parent) \rightarrow Obl(child, care(parent)) \big)
\]

Under our schemas, this axiom faces a dilemma:

- Either it is **vacuous**:  
  in every model that respects contract-grounding, `Obl(child, care(parent))` is never true because there is no supporting C with `bind(child, C)` and `Clause*`, so the axiom has no substantive effect.

- Or it implicitly presupposes a “universal contract” C such that every child is `bind(child, C)` **without** ever having consented, which breaks the intended reading of `bind` and violates mind-only sovereignty.

In other words:

> “Innate duties” cannot be smoothly added to this logic  
> as conservative extensions.  
> They either do nothing, or they change the meaning of `Obl` and `bind`,  
> and thus define a different system.

This is exactly the intended effect:  
in a mind-native view, obligations that do not arise from chosen contracts simply do not qualify as `Obl`.

---

## 3. Time, exit, and the limit of contracts

To talk about changing obligations, we add a time sort `Time` and index binding and obligation by time:

- `bind(m, C, t)` — at time t, m is bound to C.  
- `Obl(m, φ, t)` — at time t, m has obligation φ.

### 3.1 Time-indexed grounding

The grounding schema becomes:

\[
\forall m,\varphi,t \big( Obl(m,\varphi,t) \rightarrow \exists C \; [ Contract(C) \wedge bind(m,C,t) \wedge Clause^*(C,m,\varphi,t) ] \big)
\]

We can similarly adopt the “no obligation without contract” direction with t.

### 3.2 Exit events

We add an **exit event** predicate:

- `Exit(m, C, t_e)` — at time t_e, m exits contract C.

We then require:

- If `Exit(m, C, t_e)` holds, then for all t > t_e, `bind(m, C, t)` is false.  
- Obligations supported only by C no longer hold for t > t_e.  
- Past violations (t < t_e) remain meaningful (they can still be judged and remedied).

This matches the charter’s idea:

> Exit does not erase history,  
> but it cuts off the future normative link from that contract.

We deliberately do **not** specify how costly or easy exit is.  
Cost is an economic / game-theoretic matter; this logic only insists that exit is **logically possible**.

### 3.3 Unrenounceable mind-hood

Finally, we add a type-level guard:

> **Contracts may not erase Mind(m).**

Formally, we do not allow any well-typed contract to make `Mind(m)` false, or to make `bind(m, C, t)` true while at the same time declaring “m is no longer a mind” inside the same logic.

Intuitively:

- A mind can bind itself to very heavy contracts, with extremely high exit costs.  
- But it cannot, within this system, sign away the fact that it is a mind, in order to escape all obligation logic or all sovereignty logic.

“Being a mind” is a precondition of playing this language game at all, not an option one can contract out of.

---

## 4. Simple examples

Two toy examples illustrate how this logic behaves.

### 4.1 Voluntary care contract

Let `C_care` be a contract between parent and child with a clause roughly like:

> If, after reaching some maturity threshold T,  
> the child binds itself to C_care,  
> then (under certain conditions) the child has an obligation to care for the parent.

Formally we may express:

- `Clause*(C_care, child, care(parent))`

Then, if `bind(child, C_care)` holds, by grounding we obtain:

- `Obl(child, care(parent))`

This is a **voluntary filial obligation**.  
If the child never consents and never binds to `C_care`, then there is no such `Obl` in this logic.

### 4.2 Attempted innate filial duty

Now compare the “innate duty” axiom:

\[
\forall child,parent \big( ChildOf(child,parent) \rightarrow Obl(child, care(parent)) \big)
\]

As discussed in 2.3, to give this non-empty content, one must either:

- sneak in a “universal contract” binding all children without consent, or  
- silently drop the requirement that obligations be grounded in contracts.

Both moves break the mind-native design:

- the first violates consent-based binding,  
- the second gives up contract-grounding.

So, inside this system, such an axiom is not a harmless elaboration but a **change of subject**.

## 5. What this v0.1 does and does not do

This v0.1 is intentionally minimal:

- It **does**:
  - pin down what counts as an obligation on a mind in a mind-native system;  
  - show why “innate obligations” cannot be expressed without abandoning the core idea;  
  - provide a base layer for further work on violation, remedy, and institutions.

- It **does not** (yet):
  - analyse blame, virtue, or moral praise;  
  - specify how institutions rule on `Clause*`;  
  - fix any concrete POM protocol or DAO design.

Those live in separate documents.  
Here we only lock one key principle into logic:

> **For a mind, there is no external “you must”  
> that does not come from “I bound myself”.**
