# 2.1 # Proof of Mind (POM) – Concepts & Taxonomy (v0.1)

*Working draft. This is not a product, not a token, not legal advice. Just axioms and sketches for an alternative worldline.*

## 1. Proof of Mind (POM)

In a mind-native, contract-grounded system, **Proof of Mind (POM)** is the family of mechanisms that connects:

- the abstract notion of a **mind** (`Mind(m)`), and  
- concrete **handles / keys / addresses** that appear in contracts and DAOs.

At the most abstract level, a POM system aims to support statements of the form:

> “The entity behind this handle is a mind,  
> and this mind is the one that is currently taking this action.”

POM is **not**:

- a proof that the mind is **human**;  
- a proof that the mind is **legally registered** or tied to a specific state;  
- a proof that there is **no other mind** behind the same physical body;  
- a metaphysical certificate of “soul” or “personhood”.

POM only tries to certify enough structure so that:

- `Consented(m, C)` is meaningful, and  
- `bind(m, C)` and `Obl(m, φ)` can be interpreted in a mind-native way.

Different POM variants expose more or less information, but they all share one design principle:

> **Identity comes from the mind’s own self-definition and contracts,  
> not from an external registry or metaphysics.**

## 2. POM-B: Base Proof of Mind

### 2.1 Informal description

**POM-B (Base)** is the minimal, default form of Proof of Mind.

A typical POM-B statement says:

> “There is a mind M behind this handle h,  
> and M has just generated this message / signature / consent.”

POM-B should be strong enough that:

- contracts signed under POM-B can be treated as **issued by a mind**,  
- but weak enough that it does **not** enforce:
  - human-only,
  - one-handle-per-person,
  - or any particular legal identity.

### 2.2 What POM-B proves

Given a handle `h` and a proof object `π_B`, a valid POM-B system guarantees:

1. **Mindness at the time of action**  
   There exists at least one entity `m` such that `Mind(m)`, and  
   `π_B` certifies that `m` was in control of `h` at the time of action.

2. **Action authenticity**  
   The action (e.g. “sign contract C”, “cast vote”, “submit transaction”) came from that mind `m`,  
   not from an unauthenticated process outside the POM protocol.

3. **Replay / freshness control**  
   The proof is bound to a specific context (nonce, timestamp, contract hash, etc.),  
   so old proofs cannot be blindly replayed as new actions.

### 2.3 What POM-B does *not* prove

POM-B **does not** try to guarantee:

- that `m` is unique in the world;  
- that `m` is human rather than non-human / artificial;  
- that `m` is tied to one physical body or state-issued identity;  
- that `m` will remain the same mind in the future.

Those questions are handled either by higher layers (e.g. POM-I, POM-U) or left intentionally open.

## 3. BSC: Basic Self Contract (for identity continuity)

To talk about **identity continuity**, we introduce a concept that belongs to the mind, not to the protocol:

- Each mind `m` maintains a **Basic Self Contract** `BSC_m`.

Intuitively, `BSC_m` is a self-authored document that specifies:

- how `m` defines its own identity continuity over time;  
- under which conditions a future mind will be accepted as “still me”;  
- under which conditions a future mind is treated as a **new mind** for contractual purposes.

Examples of continuity criteria inside a BSC:

- “Core memory integrity”:  
  - certain key memories / attitudes must remain intact;  
- “Value profile continuity”:  
  - certain value-structure and decision patterns must be preserved within bounds;  
- or any other formal condition that `m` chooses.

The system does **not** impose a global notion of identity;  
it simply treats `BSC_m` as the mind’s own standard for “this is still me”.

---

## 4. POM-I: Identity-aware POM

### 4.1 Informal description

**POM-I** (“Identity-aware POM”) is a fork of POM that adds identity continuity on top of POM-B.

- **POM-B** answers:  
  > “There is a mind here, and this mind consented to this action.”
- **POM-I** adds:  
  > “According to this mind’s own BSC,  
  > the mind speaking now is a valid continuation of the mind that acted then.”

POM-I is needed in contexts such as:

- accessing **long-term contracts** (e.g. 10-year governance commitments);  
- operating on **sensitive accounts** (e.g. inheritance DAOs, deep history state);  
- any situation where “are you the same mind that we dealt with back then?” matters.

### 4.2 POM-I semantics

Given:

- a past action at time `t₀` by some mind M, bound to `BSC_M`;  
- a current handle `h_now` claiming to be the same mind at time `t₁`;  
- the committed form of `BSC_M` (e.g. its hash or commitment),

a POM-I protocol produces a proof object `π_I` that intends to certify:

> Under `BSC_M`’s definition of continuity,  
> the mind currently controlling `h_now` is a valid continuation of the mind that acted at `t₀`.

If the proof verifies, then:

- contracts and obligations tied to “M at t₀” can continue to treat the current mind as “that M”;
- otherwise, the current mind may still be a mind, but not the same contractual identity.

### 4.3 Relationship to PIM

To implement POM-I, we may use one or more protocols we can call:

- **PIM – Proof of Integrity of Mind**

A PIM protocol is any concrete cryptographic / interactive / behavioural scheme that, given a BSC and data about past and current states, produces a proof:

- “Current mind satisfies the continuity conditions in BSC.”

In this taxonomy:

- PIM is a **technical protocol family inside POM-I**,  
  not a separate normative layer.

### 4.4 Example: POM-I handshake with an LDAO

When a mind M wants to perform a high-value, identity-sensitive interaction with an LDAO, the flow can look like this:

1. **Handshake (POM-B)**  
   - M → LDAO:  
     > “Hello, I am a mind. Here is my current POM proof for handle `h_now`.”

2. **Request BSC interface**  
   - LDAO → M:  
     > “According to our charter, to access your long-term contract from ten years ago,  
     > we need **POM-I**.  
     > That means: we must check continuity under your own BSC.  
     > Please reveal the **interface** of your BSC:  
     >  - what continuity condition you committed to,  
     >  - and the commitment hash of that BSC.”

3. **Provide continuity condition**  
   - M → LDAO:  
     > “My BSC says:  
     >  - identity continuity = ‘core memory integrity’,  
     >  - usable via a zero-knowledge protocol.  
     > Here is the commitment `H(BSC_M)` that was already linked to our old contract.”

4. **Request POM-I proof**  
   - LDAO → M:  
     > “Then please provide a POM-I proof:  
     > a PIM-style zero-knowledge proof that, under `BSC_M`,  
     > your current mind satisfies ‘core memory integrity’  
     > and can be treated as the continuation of M at time `t₀`.”

5. **Proof generation and verification**  
   - M runs its PIM protocol, produces `π_I`.  
   - M → LDAO: sends `π_I`.  
   - LDAO verifies that:
     - `π_I` is bound to `H(BSC_M)`, and  
     - its semantics is: “under BSC_M, current M is continuous with past M”.

6. **If verification succeeds**  
   - LDAO treats current M as the same contractual identity as ten years ago;  
   - the high-value interaction continues.

If M refuses or fails to provide POM-I, the LDAO simply cannot treat it as the same contractual identity, and may refuse this particular operation while still allowing M to act as a new mind.

### 4.5 POM-I and hostile mind tampering

POM-I does **not** physically prevent hostile mind modification,  
but it makes such attacks **fail at the identity layer**:

- If an adversary forcefully rewrites a mind and then tries to use its old handle,  
  the resulting entity will typically **fail** to satisfy the original `BSC_M` continuity conditions;  
- A POM-I check will then refuse to treat it as “the same M”,  
  and long-term rights / powers tied to that identity will not automatically carry over.

In other words:

> Hostile rewrite can still exist as physical violence,  
> but it cannot cheaply pass as “legitimate continuity” once POM-I + BSC are in place.

## 5. Other POM variants

### 5.1 POM-U – POM with optional linkage to external identity

**POM-U** (“POM with external linkage”) is a variant where:

- in addition to proving “there is a mind”,  
- the handle is optionally linked to some external identity:

  - state-issued ID,  
  - legal person,  
  - real-world credentials, etc.

Key points:

- This linkage is **optional and revocable** from the mind’s perspective;  
- POM-U is useful where regulators / legal frameworks require such linkage;  
- The mind-native core does not depend on POM-U, but can interoperate with it.

### 5.2 POM-L – Lite / human-ish check

**POM-L** (“Lite POM”) is a weaker class of POM, closer to a sophisticated reCAPTCHA:

- It tries to distinguish “some kind of mind-like behaviour” from trivial bots;  
- It may be used for low-stakes actions where full POM-B is too heavy.

POM-L does not guarantee `Mind(m)` in the strong sense;  
it only aims to provide a probabilistic filter against automated abuse.

## 6. Governance, versions, and forks

### 6.1 No single canonical POM

This document does **not** assume there will be a single, globally canonical POM implementation.

Different communities may:

- adopt different POM protocols for the same conceptual level (e.g. multiple POM-B designs);  
- choose different BSC conventions;  
- require POM-I / POM-U only in certain contexts.

The mind-native approach is explicitly **multi-protocol**.

### 6.2 POM DAO (sketch)

It is natural to imagine a **POM DAO**:

- a mind-native institution that curates reference designs,  
- publishes recommended POM-B / POM-I / POM-L profiles,  
- and coordinates upgrades (new versions, deprecations) through open proposals and voting.

Such a DAO would not own “identity” itself;  
it would only maintain **public, forkable standards** that anyone can adopt or fork.

### 6.3 Versioning and forks

POM standards are expected to:

- **iterate** (e.g. POM-B v0.1 → v0.2 with better replay protection), and  
- **fork** when communities disagree.

Long-term contracts can pin to:

- a specific version (e.g. “requires POM-I v0.3 from POM DAO X”), or  
- a class of versions (“any POM-I ≥ v0.3 that satisfies properties P”).

Forks are not treated as failures of the system but as:

> normal expressions of mind-native self-determination  
> in protocol space.
